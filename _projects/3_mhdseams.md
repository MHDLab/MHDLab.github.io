The SEAMS were a series of conference proceedings on the topic of magnetohydrodynamic power generation, called the Symposium on the Engineering Aspects of Magnetohydrodynamics (SEAM). The SEAM conferences took place nearly yearly from 1961 to 1997. 

We have recently digitized this collection of works and released them on DOE's [Energy Data Exchange](https://edx.netl.doe.gov/group/about/symposia-on-the-enineering-aspects-of-magnetohydrodynamics)


Below is an interactive plot showing natural language processing results grouping the papers from the SEAMs.
