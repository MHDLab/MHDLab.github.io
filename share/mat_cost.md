This page is an ongoing attempt to consolidate data from the literature on the material cost floor for the energy capital cost ($\\$/kWh$) for different energy types suitable for long duration storage. 



# Levelized cost of storage (LCOS)

A key metric for energy storage systems is levelized cost of storage (**LCOS**) which can be defined as the extra cost, in addition to the **Price of Electricty** paid by the system operator, that must be charged to make the energy storage system economically viable.

With some simplifying assumptions we can derive an expression of the LCOS:

$$
LCOS[$/kWh] = (\frac{1}{\eta_{RT}} -1) * C_{E,in} + \frac{1}{LT*\eta_{out}}(C_{kW} + C_{kWh} * DD)
$$

## LCOS Duration dependence

Below is an interactive plot to explore how LCOS depends on duration for a fixed $C_{E,in}$ = 0.025\\$/kWh. We will also make the simplifying approximation that $\eta_{RT} \approx \eta_{out}$. Note: you have to move the sliders to initialize the visualization.

## Regions of viability

 We can find economically viable combinations of $C_{kW}$ and  $C_{kWh}$ by solving the LCOS equation for the maximum allowable $C_{kW}$ as a funciton of $C_{kWh}$, defining a tradeoff curve of economic viabaility.  

$$
C_{kW} = LT*\eta_{RT}[LCOS - (\frac{1}{\eta_{RT}} - 1)*C_{E,in}] - C_{kWh}*DD
$$

Below is an interactive plot to explore this line of economic viability. Regions to the left and below of the line are viable. Note: you have to move the sliders to initialize the visualization.

# LCOS for Long Duration Storage 

For long durations the last term will begin to dominate the expression and the LCOS can be approximated 

$$
LCOS \approx \frac{C_{kWh}}{Lifetime*\eta_{out}} * Duration
$$

The scaling factor with duration represents the key figure of merit for long duration energy storage systems. In this expression the component that will be able to vary over many orders of magnitude is $C_{kWh}$ and therefore could be considered the most important. We can get a handle on the ballpark of what $C_{kWh}$ is required by considering a long-duraiton energy storage system with the following characteristics

* LCOS of of 10Â¢/kWh
* Duration of 100 hours
* Lifetime of 10 years (~$10^5$ hours) and  
* $ \eta_{out} = 1$

We calculate $ C_{kWh} <\approx \\$100/kWh $ meaning a energy storage medium cannot have a capital cost significantly above this to be viable for durations on the order of 100 hours. The more careful analysis including discount rate, O&M, efficiency etc. by Albertus above puts this number about an order of magnitude lower at $ C_{kWh} <\approx \\$10/kWh $ for ~100 hours of storage.

# Materials Cost Floor

The cost of the material that the storage medium is built out of sets a lower bound on the achievable $C_{kWh}$. Therefore we meed to find a storage medium with a **material energy capital cost $(C_{kWh, mat})$** than approximately $ 10\\$/kWh$. Below is a plot that shows calculated $C_{kWh, mat}$ for a wide range of storage media.  Mouse over to see the name of the material. This plot is an ongoing work in progress with more data to be added.

$C_{kWh, mat}$ is calculated from the energy density, $\rho_E$ [kWh/kg], of the storage media (storing a given form of enegy) and the material price, $C_{mat}$  [\\$/kg], of the materials used in the storage media through the equation $C_{kWh, mat} = \frac{C_{mat}}{\rho_E}$. The plot below breaks out each storage medium into the material cost and energy density used to calculate $C_{kWh, mat}$ above. Click on a storage medium type in the legend to hide that class of storage medium. The line indicates  $C_{kWh, mat} = 10\\$/kWh$
