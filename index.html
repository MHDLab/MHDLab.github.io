<h1>MHD Generators </h1>


A MHD generator is an electric generator without moving parts. Because of the
lack of moving parts, MHD generators can run at high temperatures. The high
temperatures enables higher efficiency, but most importantly oxy-fuel based
carbon capture. However, the lack of moving parts also introduces formidable
engineering challenges. The goal of the MHD group is to reexamine the prospect
of overcoming these challenges with modern scientific insights and technology.

<h1>Advanced diagnostics</h1>

Paired with historical knowledge, we want to use new experimental technology to try and overcome these engieering challenges. 

For example, we have recently developed a real-time absorption-emission setup to generate time-series potassium number density.

Below you can see data and fits used to determine the potassium number densities for different 'Test Cases'. Note: certain combinations do not exist.
